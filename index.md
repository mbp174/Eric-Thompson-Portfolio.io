# Eric Thompson's Portfolio
Welcome!  This is where you can find examples of projects I've completed on my coding journey.

Even though I'm new to coding, I've been working on learning more every day.  Currently, I am using Codecademy's Data Scientist path to learn the skills I need for a future in programming.  This includes Python, SQL, web scraping, data cleaning, summary statistics, data visualization, natural language processing, and machine learning.

## Projects
### <a href="https://github.com/mbp174/Codecademy---Python-Hurricane-Project">Codecademy Python Project</a> 
Project goals required writing several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each function used a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.

### <a href="https://github.com/mbp174/Die_Simulator">Bonus: Dice Poker</a>
Fun project that simulates playing poker with dice.  It was inspired by playing The Witcher shortly after building my PC.  This represents my first Python project that I completely selected for myself.  Even though there is undoudtedly room for improvement, it does work as intended and is just as fun to play as in the video game!
