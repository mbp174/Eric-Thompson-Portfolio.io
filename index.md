# Eric Thompson's Portfolio
Welcome!  This is where you can find examples of projects I've completed on my coding journey.

Even though I'm new to coding, I've been working on learning more every day.  Currently, I am using Codecademy's Data Scientist path to learn the skills I need for a future in programming.  This includes Python, SQL, web scraping, data cleaning, summary statistics, data visualization, natural language processing, and machine learning.
